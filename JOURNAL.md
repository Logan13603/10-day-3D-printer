## 7/20:
Stayed up until 2:30am cadding after first hearing about this, got in about 2 hours of work. I wanted to do a basic bedslinger design. I found some issues with sourcing my y axis bed and carriage, so i decided to just get a custom carriage and use the kp3s bed heated bed, might try to find a cheaper one though, I'm already at like $200 including electronics, so I might need to adjust things or get rid of the linear rails and swap to v wheels to save money. Overall i think this was a great first day of cadding, I have a strong foundation to build on top of and add all the other various components. I think tomorrow im gonna make the Y carriage better and add the linear rail mounts. Heres a pic of the basic frame I completed

I also made the first version of the y axis carriage.

I fully redesigned the carriage, so it looks sleeker and saves weight. Made some simple linear rail to my custom carriage mounts. I finished the Y axis, fusion was being kind of weird with fillets, but i worked past it. X axis up next, but im having some issues with the pull request on GitHub for my project, so I asked for help in the slack. I added 2 Y axis motors for more speed, double shear for higher belt tensions without bending the motor shaft, and 9mm belts for faster preformance.
