## 7/20:
Stayed up until 2:30am cadding after first hearing about this, got in about 2 hours of work. I wanted to do a basic bedslinger design. I found some issues with sourcing my y axis bed and carriage, so i decided to just get a custom carriage and use the kp3s bed heated bed, might try to find a cheaper one though, I'm already at like $200 including electronics, so I might need to adjust things or get rid of the linear rails and swap to v wheels to save money. Overall i think this was a great first day of cadding, I have a strong foundation to build on top of and add all the other various components. I think tomorrow im gonna make the Y carriage better and add the linear rail mounts. Heres a pic of the basic frame I completed

I also made the first version of the y axis carriage.

#### I spent 2 hours 23 minutes cadding today.

I fully redesigned the carriage, so it looks sleeker and saves weight. Made some simple linear rail to my custom carriage mounts. I finished the Y axis, fusion was being kind of weird with fillets, but i worked past it. X axis up next, but im having some issues with the pull request on GitHub for my project, so I asked for help in the slack. I added 2 Y axis motors for more speed, double shear for higher belt tensions without bending the motor shaft, and 9mm belts for faster preformance.

X axis up next, but I'm having some issues with the pull request on GitHub for my project, so I asked for help in the slack, and then submitted a pull request. Making the X axis motor mount is pretty difficult, maybe I should've used linear rods for the x axis to simplify things. I'm not sure how strong it will be. I finished the Z axis, to be honest it was sort of hard. I think I'm going to use a M5 bolt for my x axis tensioner, and an M3 screw with a heatset insert to actually tension it.  So far I've spent around 8 hours building this today, the toolhead is probably gonna be the hardest part, I plan to start that tomorrow.

I think I'm gonna go with the protoxtruder, and tzv6 hotend, and probably 2 5015 fans for cooling. As I suspected, the fan ducts are very difficult to cad, and my whole toolhead looks like a big block.

I made the actual fan ducts now.

I would say the hardest part so far of the entire thing is making the mounts for the fan to screw into because they need to be at an angle.
Just figured out how to do that!

Overall the toolhead wasn't as hard to cad as I thought it would be, maybe I'm just better at cad now. The CAD is now finished. I can polish it and make it work better after I assemble it and see what needs improvement. I just finished the BOM, about half of it is from amazon, for some reason amazon is cheaper than AliExpress for some things.
